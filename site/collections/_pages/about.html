          <p>
            I am <strong>Kuan-You Lin</strong>, a graduate student from Cornell, software developers... essentially a legal alien in New York, trying to find its way of living, with nothing but a heart and a desire for learning and adventures. I moved to New York in 2021 from Taiwan to advance my degree in <strong>Information Systems and Applied Information Science</strong> (yes..they somehow have a program with 2 astonishing similar degrees to offer, all packed in 2 years). I interned at Circle, the company that issues USDC, the second largest stable coin, and mainly worked on the frontend of a multi-user stablecoin vault called Circle Account with <strong>TypeScript and React-ish libraries</strong>. On the other hand, I spent half of my time helping re-organize and extend a newly acquired entity with <strong>Java</strong>, primarily for the data access object(DAO). All my work was done in production standard, and I cooperated with other engineers directly in CI/CD and Agile working style.
          </p><p>
            Before moving to the US, I had a major in International Business and a couple of experiences in business analysis and computational finance, including internship at Allianz Global Investors, BNP Paribas Cardif, and Yuanta Financial Holdings (Proprietary Trading). At the time, I thought about being a consultant or a banker like all the other business students did, which I sometimes find funny in retrospect.
          </p><p>
            My main interest right now is to design and build an easily maintainable, not overly engineered, quick and responsive software or product. I therefore invest most of my time in <strong>architectures, low-level behaviors of languages, algorithms, and designs of data structures</strong>, and am still open to other topics as I try to converge my expertise. 
          </p><p>
            I started this website to collect and share some study notes, organize my projects, and perhaps most importantly, help me find a good job ☺️.
          </p><p>
            By the way, I have organized my journey so far in bullet points below. If you enjoy enumerative reading more, you might find the following section suits your needs.
